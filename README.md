# DogBreedPrediction

**Technique: Supervised Learning** 
It is convenient to use this method in image processing projects with a certain number of classes. We foresee that we will specify the dog breeds in our data set, which we will use as input, and the machine will make a prediction based on this. For this reason, Supervised Learning was used.

**Type: Classification Problem**
At the end of the project, our problem is a classification problem, as our output will represent a certain group.

**Deep Learning Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
Among the Deep Learning methods, CNN is a deep learning algorithm that is generally used in image processing and takes images as input, and in classification problems, a model is mostly created according to this architecture.

**Language: Pyhton**
**Libraries: Keras & Tensorflow & Numpy & Sklearn**
**Data Set: 10222 and 120 Different Breed**
Pictures number for breed classification is 10222 and there is 120 different breed.

**Model**
Activation function: Relu & Softmax
Loss: Categorical Cross Entropy
Optimizer: Adam

After all processes we will have one local application and it shows us the breed of dog that we uploaded.
